# Cloud IDE

Cloud IDE is a multi-user cloud-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) management system built on Kubernetes and VS Code Server. It allows you to create and access a VS Code instance in the cloud using a web browser.

## Features

- **Multi-user Support:** Cloud IDE provides a multi-user environment where each user can have their own isolated workspace.
- **Browser Access:** Users can access their IDEs through a web browser, eliminating the need for local installations.
- **VS Code Integration:** Cloud IDE leverages the power of VS Code, providing a rich set of features for code editing, debugging, and extensions.
- **Cloud-based:** The IDE instances are hosted in the cloud, ensuring scalability, availability, and flexibility.
- **Workspace Management:** Cloud IDE offers workspace management capabilities, allowing users to create and manage their projects easily.
